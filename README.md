# Co-Design Toolkit

This toolkit is designed for anyone involved in creating environmental data services and products, including researchers, developers, designers, and project managers. The toolkit includes a variety of resources, such as case studies showcasing successful UX in environmental data products, templates for UX deliverables, and links to external tools.

# How to contribute to this toolkit

We encourage community contributions! You can share your own resources, case studies, or suggest improvements via our GitHub repository. You can also get in touch with us at ux@bgs.ac.uk

## Add new Case Studies

> Case studies showcase real-world examples of how UX (User Experience) methods have been successfully applied to address **environmental data** challenges. Your contributions should include a brief overview of the project, the specific UX methods used (e.g., design sprints, user research, prototyping), the outcomes achieved, and any key takeaways for others working on similar projects. Your case studies will inspire and guide others in the field, demonstrating the power of user-centered design.
